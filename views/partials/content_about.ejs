    <p class="about-p-3">"The future is something uncertain, but the only certain thing is that we are the ones who visualize it and build it. Today that is my purpose. I am visualizing my future and my future is based on my personal growth to be able to help human development by creating tools that facilitate and innovate the way of living every day through the use of technology, being the creation and development of software one of the most important aspects to achieve this purpose. I am sure that the best tool to achieve this goal is: knowledge." - Me.</p>

    <p class="about-p-3">““Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” - Steve Jobs</p>

    <p class="about-p-3">"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough." - Elon Musk</p>

    <p class="about-p-3">"The competition is not against others; only against yourself." - Laura Gutierrez</p>
